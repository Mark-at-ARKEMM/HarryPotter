An example app using data obtained from https://hp-api.herokuapp.com; one of the public api's available from https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis/blob/master/README.md

The app uses Swift 6, Async / await & Swift Testing & supports iOS 17+

Although the design is possibly overEngineered for a small app, it demonstrates clear separation of concerns which typically would be expected in more sophisticated applications; paying attention to maintaining clear API boundaries & models.
